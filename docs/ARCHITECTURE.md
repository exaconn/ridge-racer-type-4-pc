# Architecture

The native target compiles and runs the original C modules from
`ridge-racer-type-4-decomp`, repaired in place under `src/main/` and
`src/overlays/`, using CMake and PsyZ (`third_party/psyz`). No parallel game
engine, historical PS1 compiler, splat step, PS1 linker script or retail
checksum check is used.

## Native build and module integration

```
src/main/ + src/overlays/ -> host C11 compiler -> original game + PsyZ
```

1. **Resident executable (`src/main/`):**
   - `system/` — main loop, mode table dispatch (`ModeFuncTable`), frame task
     scheduler, pad polling and dual-actuator rumble.
   - `data/` — `R4.BIN` archive directory, asynchronous CD/sector streaming,
     relative file (`RelocateRelativeFile`) unpacking, memory card state
     machine and save data serialization.
   - `gfx/` — double-buffered `DRAWENV`/`DISPENV`, ordering tables, GTE course
     and car model projection (`model.c`, `gtemodel.c`, `gtepoly*.c`), skybox,
     billboards, rear-view mirror and screen fades.
   - `course/` — track node splines, surface projection, collision bounds,
     visibility octants and animated track objects.
   - `car/` — player and AI vehicle physics, tire grip, slipstream, collisions,
     replay recording and articulated wheel/body transforms.
   - `camera/` — race chase, cockpit, intro, finish and replay camera splines.
   - `race/` — race state machine, standings, lap/split timing and HUD.
   - `menu/` & `ui/` — mode select, Grand Prix story/dialogue panels, save UI,
     badge rows, glyph lists and UI windows.
   - `sound/` — VAB bank loader, engine voice pitch/pan synthesis, sequence
     queue and CD-XA / stream audio control.
   - `demo/` & `effect/` — opening/attract sequences, lens flare and spark
     particles.
2. **Statically linked overlays (`src/overlays/`):**
   - In retail PS1, `R4.BIN` entries `659..668` are loaded on demand into
     `0x80114998`. In the native port, all nine overlay modules (`grand_prix`,
     `time_attack`, `versus`, `garage`, `records`, `options`, `extra_trial`,
     `serial_link`, `movie_playback`) are linked statically and dispatched by
     mode/overlay ID without overwriting code in a fixed RAM window.
3. **PsyZ runtime (`third_party/psyz/`):**
   - Provides `libgpu`, `libgte`, `libspu`, `libetc`, `libpad`, `libcd`,
     `libpress` (MDEC) and SDL3 window/audio/input integration.
