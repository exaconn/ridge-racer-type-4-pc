/* Video timing (Escape menu Graphics > Video timing, RR4_VIDEO=ntsc).
 *
 * PAL, the default, is this disc as released: SetVideoMode(MODE_PAL),
 * 49.75 Hz fields, races at 25 frames a second. The PAL release is the
 * NTSC game with every value that counts frames converted to 25 frames a
 * second (5/6 of the NTSC count: durations, timers, frames per second in
 * time conversions, animation rates); the per-frame physics, AI and car
 * data are the NTSC ones, so on PAL the cars cover 5/6 of the NTSC
 * distance per second of real time.
 *
 * NTSC runs the PAL disc as the NTSC release does: SetVideoMode(MODE_NTSC),
 * 59.82 Hz fields, races at 30 frames a second, and at each place the PAL
 * release changed for 25 frames a second the value of the NTSC release
 * (SLPS-01800, compared function by function). Picture layout, language,
 * content and fixes of the PAL release stay as they are.
 *
 * The choice is made once at startup, before MainLoop; it is not changed
 * while the game runs. */
