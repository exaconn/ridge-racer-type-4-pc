/* Frame interpolation (Escape menu Graphics > Frame interpolation). A race
 * frame takes two fields; PsyZ presents a midpoint between two frames at the
 * blank between them (Psyz_GpuPrepareInterpolatedBlank in MainLoop). The
 * packets come from a linear arena, so their addresses do not pair across
 * frames: each 3D packet is tagged with a stable identity instead
 * (Psyz_GpuTagInterpolationPacket), made of
 *
 *   - the view (ActiveViewportIndex: race, mirror, split-screen half),
 *   - the object being drawn (InterpObject: a car and its part, a track
 *     object placement, the course, the scenery, an effect), set by the
 *     callers around their draws, and
 *   - a key from the renderer: the face or tile record in the loaded model
 *     data, the level of detail and the piece of a subdivided tile.
 *
 * PsyZ draws a tagged packet at the midpoint of its two poses when the
 * previous frame drew the same identity with the same texture coordinates;
 * anything else (a new tile, a level-of-detail change, untagged HUD and 2D
 * packets) keeps its own pose. A camera cut (InterpCameraCut, and a jump of
 * the view's camera between frames) drops the pairs of that frame.
 *
 * With the option off InterpObject stays 0 and nothing is tagged. */
